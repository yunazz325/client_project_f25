        <p>
            Networking is one of the most powerful tools in the job search process.
Studies show that more than 70% of job opportunities are never publicly advertised but are instead filled through referrals and personal connections. Building and maintaining a strong professional network allows you to access hidden opportunities, gain insider knowledge about industries and companies, and receive guidance from experienced professionals. Effective networking is not just about asking for a job — it’s about building genuine relationships that can support your career growth in the long term.
